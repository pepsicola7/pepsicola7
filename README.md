## 📚 My Favorite Projects

- **Push_swap** https://github.com/pepsicola7/Push_swap – My first big challenge in algorithms.  
  Implemented an efficient sorting algorithm using **two stacks** and a limited set of operations.  
  I learned how to optimize complexity and minimize the number of moves.  

- **So_long** – The first time I built a **2D game**.  
  Developed with a simple **graphical library (MiniLibX)**, handling **player movement, collisions, map parsing, and basic rendering**.  
  It was an amazing feeling to see my project become *visible* and interactive.  

- **Minishell** https://github.com/pepsicola7/minishell – One of the hardest challenges at that time.  
  Implemented a **small Unix shell** supporting **pipes, redirections, environment variables, and built-in commands**.  
  This project taught me how to **structure code, manage processes, and think step by step** like a real system engineer.
